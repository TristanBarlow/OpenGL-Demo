# OpenGL-Demo

For this project, I create a SceneGraph that used OpenGL as the rendering API  and SDL2 to provide the window contexts. This project was written using C++ and I integrated the BulletPhysics library to provide the physics simulation. My main focus of this project was to create a good infrastructure for post-processing effects. Using GLSL I created a bloom effect with a Gaussian Blur. As there are so many elements that come together to create a scenegraph the design of the program was a particular challenge.
